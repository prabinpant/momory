# Momory

**Virtual-Unlimited-Memory AI Agent**

An intelligent AI agent with persistent, scalable memory that operates beyond traditional context window limitations.

## 🎯 What We're Building

MOMO is a local AI agent that fundamentally redefines how AI systems handle memory:

- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers facts, preferences, and decisions across sessions
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Only retrieves relevant context, never dumps entire history
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles thousands of memories via retrieval + summarization
- **External Storage**: Memory lives outside the LLM context window in SQLite + vector embeddings

### Core Principle

```
memory ≠ context window
memory = external store + retrieval + compaction + intelligence
```

The LLM (Gemini) is stateless. All memory is external, selective, and retrieved on-demand.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Memory Types

1. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**
   - Recent conversation turns
   - In-memory only, session-scoped
   - Provides conversation coherence

2. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**
   - Atomic facts, decisions, preferences, observations
   - Persisted to SQLite with vector embeddings
   - Retrieved via semantic similarity

3. **Summary Memory (Chunked)**
   - Compressed historical context
   - Generated periodically to prevent memory explosion
   - **Chunked before embedding** (400 tokens, 80 token overlap)
   - Each chunk gets focused embedding for accurate retrieval
   - 10:1 compression ratio target

### Chunking Strategy

Inspired by [Clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot), Momory uses chunking to prevent embedding dilution:

```typescript
// Problem: Mixed-topic content creates diluted embeddings
"User is a Python developer. Loves pizza. Traveled to Japan."
→ Single embedding (33% each topic) → Lower accuracy

// Solution: Chunk before embedding
Chunk 1: "User is a Python developer..."  → Programming-focused
Chunk 2: "Loves pizza and pasta..."       → Food-focused
Chunk 3: "Traveled to Japan..."           → Travel-focused
→ Each chunk = focused embedding → Higher accuracy
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents semantic dilution in embeddings
- Each chunk retrieves only relevant content
- 20% overlap preserves context across boundaries

### Agent Execution Loop

Every interaction follows this pipeline:

1. **Receive Input** - User message/task
2. **Retrieve Memory** - Vector search for relevant context
3. **Construct Prompt** - Inject retrieved memories + summaries (chunked)
4. **LLM Reasoning** - Gemini generates response
5. **Extract Memories** - Decide what's worth remembering
6. **Persist** - Store to LTM with embeddings
7. **Maintenance** - Summarize (with chunking), decay, prune (conditional)

**Key Innovation:** Summaries are chunked before embedding, ensuring each chunk has focused semantics for accurate retrieval.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **LLM**: Gemini API (text generation + embeddings)
- **Database**: SQLite with vector similarity
- **Architecture**: Result types, strict typing, structured logging
- **Memory Strategy**: Chunked embeddings (inspired by Clawdbot)

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Cross-Session Recall** - Restart the agent, it still remembers
- ✅ **Relevant Retrieval** - Only injects contextually relevant memories
- ✅ **Chunked Embeddings** - Prevents semantic dilution for accurate search
- ✅ **Bounded Prompts** - Never exceeds 8KB regardless of memory size
- ✅ **Intelligent Filtering** - Ignores trivial information automatically
- ✅ **Memory Decay** - Old, unused memories fade over time
- ✅ **Automatic Summarization** - Compresses old memories with chunking

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The agent is considered complete when:

1. Remembers facts across process restarts
2. Retrieval returns relevant context (not random)
3. Prompt size stays bounded
4. Old memories are compressed into summaries
5. Memory improves answer quality over time
6. Handles 1000+ memories without crashes
7. Maintenance runs without blocking UX
